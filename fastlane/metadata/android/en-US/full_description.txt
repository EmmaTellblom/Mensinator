<h1>Mensinator🩸</h1>
<p>Private period tracking with custom symptoms. We don't track your data - you do. Period.</p>
<h2>🫂 Made for friends by friends</h2>
<p>Originally Emma made Mensinator for her friend with goals of better symptom tracking and privacy respect.  <br />
Soon, many of us joined and are now actively building the Mensinator together.  <br />
It is friendly, straightforward, and respects privacy.  <br />
We wanted an app to use, not an app to sell data to random corporations.</p>
<h2>💡 Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Period and ovulation tracking and statistics,</li>
<li><strong><em>Customizable and colour-coded symptoms</em></strong>,</li>
