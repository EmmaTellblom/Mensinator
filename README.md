# Mensinator🩸
Private period tracking with custom symptoms. We don't track your data - you do. Period.

## 🫂 Made for friends by friends
Originally Emma made Mensinator for her friend with goals of better symptom tracking and privacy respect.  
Soon, many of us joined and are now actively building the Mensinator together.  
It is friendly, straightforward, and respects privacy.  
We wanted an app to use, not an app to sell data to random corporations.

## 💡 Features
- Period and ovulation tracking,
- Customizable and colour-coded symptoms,
- Statistics and cycle prediction,
- Data export and import for backups or moving to another device,
- No tracking. Your data is yours. No data is sent anywhere.
- No bloat. No useless or complex features. No sign-up. No emails.

## 🔮 Future ideas
- Different calculation types: Choose between regular and luteal prediction modes depending on (ir)regularity of your cycle,
- Whatever you suggest: Discuss ideas with users and developers on **[our Discord](https://discord.gg/tHA2k3bFRN)**. Let us know what'd be good to have.

## 🤝 Active development and user community
Join **[our Discord](https://discord.gg/tHA2k3bFRN)** to share your thoughts, ask questions, and chat with other users and our team.  
Mensinator is in early development, made by people like you. Your feedback will help us improve it.  
Some of us even stick around to nag the developers to make the app into what we want it to be. And some of us develop the features directly.
