# Mensinator🩸
Private period tracking with custom symptoms. We don't track your data - you do. Period.

## 🫂 Made for friends by friends
Originally Emma made Mensinator for her friend with goals of better symptom tracking and privacy respect.  
Soon, many of us joined and are now actively building the Mensinator together.  
It is friendly, straightforward, and respects privacy.  
We wanted an app to use, not an app to sell data to random corporations.

## 💡 Features
- Period and ovulation tracking and statistics,
- ***Customizable and colour-coded symptoms***,
- Cycle prediction with average period calculation,
- Cycle prediction with average ***luteal phase calculation for irregular cycles***,
- Data export and import for backups or moving to another device,
- No tracking. Your data is yours. No data is sent anywhere.
- No bloat. No useless or complex features. No sign-up. No emails.
