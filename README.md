## ðŸ«‚ Made for friends by friends
Originally, Emma made Mensinator for a friend who was looking for an app that would track unique period symptoms and respect her privacy.
Soon, more like-minded individuals joined the project. 
We all wanted a user-friendly, straigtforward app made for us, not an app that uses our data for profit. We are now actively building Mensinator together.
